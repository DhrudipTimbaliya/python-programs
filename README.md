# My Learning Project on GitHub

Welcome to my repository! This project is part of my journey as a student learning programming, Git, and the GitHub platform. Here, I document essential definitions, examples, and simple programs to help me—and others—get started with these tools.

## About This Project

**Purpose:**  
This repository helps me learn key programming concepts and GitHub terms, including how to create repositories, commit changes, work on branches, and manage pull requests. By documenting my progress, I can track my learning and provide a resource for anyone new to these topics.

## Key Definitions

- **Git:** A distributed version control system that tracks changes in files, allowing multiple developers to work together.
- **GitHub:** A web-based platform built around Git that offers a central hub for hosting repositories, collaborating on projects, and sharing code.
- **Repository (Repo):** A storage location for your project files, including code, images, and documentation.
- **Commit:** A snapshot recording changes made to the files in a repository. It serves as a save point in your project’s history.
- **Branch:** A divergent copy of the repository where you can develop new features or experiment without affecting the main codebase.
- **Pull Request (PR):** A proposal to merge changes from one branch into another. It’s a key part of reviewing and discussing code before merging.
- **Merge:** The process of combining changes from different branches into a single branch, typically the main branch.

## Sample Program: "Hello, World!"

Below is an example of a basic Python program demonstrating the “Hello, World!” concept:

```python
# hello.py


    print("Hello, World!")
